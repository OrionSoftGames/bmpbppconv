This tool Convert an 8bpp BMP to 4bpp, or a 4bpp BMP to 2bpp.

Usage: bmpbppconv file.bmp
Or just drag and drop your bmp file on the exe.

WARNING: Your original file will be overwritten with the new one !!!


2bpp BMP are a Valid BMP format, BUT, most of the painting/viewer program won't read/write this format !
(That's why I made this convertion tool)
The only image viewer I know that can correctly read 2bpp BMP is XnView.
